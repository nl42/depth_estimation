Quaternion toolbox for Matlab - installation instructions
---------------------------------------------------------

To install this toolbox:

1. Unzip the distribution file and move the directory/folder
   to a convenient location. This does not need to be in the
   same location as toolboxes supplied with Matlab, although
   it could be if your Matlab installation is to be used by
   multiple users on the same machine.

2. Set the Matlab path to include the directory/folder qtfm.
   This is done from the Matlab File -> Set Path menu.

3. Type 'help qtfm' in the Matlab command window for
   some words of explanation about the toolbox.

4. help quaternion/xxx shows help text for each function xxx.

5. To run a test of the toolbox, set the current directory to
   .../qftm/test and type the command 'test' in the Matlab
   command window. This runs a test of many parts of the
   toolbox and will allow you to confirm that installation is
   correct.

6. If you find the toolbox useful and would like to be kept
   informed of updates and future releases, subscribe to the
   mailing list qtfm-announce@lists.sourceforge.net. You can

7. LaTeX/BiBTeX users please note the file qtfm.bib provided
   in the directory tex/bibtex if you wish to cite QTFM itself
   or one of the published papers cited within the source code.

8. To send feedback, bug reports, please use the reporting
   mechanisms at the project webpage at Sourceforge
