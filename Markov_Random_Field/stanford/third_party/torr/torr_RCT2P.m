%next establish the four possible camera matrix pairs as points out in Maybank, Hartley & zisserman etc
%first camera is 3x4 at origin of the world system.

%given this there are four choices for the second, we normalize them so that the
%determinant of the first 3x3 is greater than zero, this is useful for determining chierality later
